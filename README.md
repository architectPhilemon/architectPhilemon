### ðŸš€ What I'm Up To

-   Currently building **Kilimo ledger DApp**. It's a **Frontend: The user-facing part built with JavaScript frameworks like React that lets farmers and managers interact with the system. It would use a Web3 library (like Web3.js) to connect to the blockchain.
Smart Contracts: The core logic of the system, written in a language like Solidity. These contracts would manage and secure all key data on the blockchain, such as farm registration, product details, and the supply chain journey.
Backend: A traditional server component using a framework like Node.js. It would handle off-chain data like user profiles and large files, and would likely use a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB for this purpose**.
-   Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on **open source project **.
-   When I'm not coding, you can find me **writing inspiration novels and storybooks**.
